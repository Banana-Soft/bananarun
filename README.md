About
---
Bananarun is a simple rhythm game written in _html5/javascript_ and developed in about 2 days by a group of young 
students/developers with a common passion (the "[Bananasoft](#Picture)") specifically for the FirefoxOS 
(though it does work also on other browsers).


We decided to make this game basically on a whim, in order to have some fun during this Campus Party and 
to show our appreciation for programming and for Mozilla.

# <a name="gameplay"></a>Gameplay
The gameplay is pretty straightforward: you just have to press 4 buttons in a timely fashion by following the beat 
of the music and a series of graphical cues on the top of the screen.

The closer you are to the right time the more points you'll get!!
There's also an internal leaderboard in which you can keep track of your previous results! 
and if this is not enough for you, rest assured, there will be special "bonuses" if you manage to get a 
perfect score.
If you want to uncover all the game's secrets you'll have to keep getting better.
